		<p>The man who is widely considered one of the most evil people in the world has died. If anyone was on his side, they were considered the scum of the earth, and they might be put on a watchlist on a good day, and tortured and possibly killed on the worst day. His wildly radical religious beliefs were the cause of a huge uproar and while many people did follow him, most of the sane world didn&#8217;t go along with it and may have even believed he was sent by Satan himself.</p>

<p>The man I&#8217;m describing is Jesus.</p>

<p>It turns out, Jesus and Osama had many things in common; Jesus probably looked a lot like Osama. Of course, there are some important differences. Jesus didn&#8217;t murder thousands of people in cold-blood (many of which were his own people) and Jesus didn&#8217;t force his religious beliefs on other, take control of various cities, leading them astray, directly into murder.</p>

<p>Nope, Jesus didn&#8217;t do that. Now we&#8217;re just talking about the Crusaders.</p>

<p>Jesus probably has a great grasp on how Osama bin Laden felt. Tired, beat down, and chased until death. Why do we want to disconnect ourselves from Osama so much? To make ourselves feel better about not killing thousands of others? In fact, Jesus himself said anger is the same as murder, but in our country, if you&#8217;ve been angry at thousands of people, you&#8217;re not considered a terrorist. In God&#8217;s eyes, we are no better than Osama bin Laden.</p>

<p>Yes, this sinner has been killed and sent to a watery grave, but why should we celebrate it? He&#8217;s dead, yes, but so what? The only reason to celebrate right now is that our wonderful, perfect God is the judge. Not Barack Obama, Osama bin Laden, news anchors, or your mom or dad, but God the Father whose reign is sovereign and ever-holy.</p>

<p>I can only hope and pray that Osama bin Laden, or any non-believer for that matter, never has to experience the weeping and gnashing of teeth, and that somehow before death Osama was able to change his ways and enter the glory of the Father. Let&#8217;s stop throwing stones at each other.</p>
