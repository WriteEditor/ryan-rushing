		<p>My name is Ryan Paul Rushing. &#8220;Ryan&#8221; means little king, and &#8220;Paul&#8221; means humble. Basically, my name means &#8220;Little humble king who is always in a hurry.&#8221;</p>

<p>I was born several years ago in a small town in Louisiana, known as Vidalia. (No. Not the place where Vidalia Onions come from. Stop asking.) I absolutely love my family, and am thankful for every moment I spend with them.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m married to an amazing artist who specializes in <a href='http://rachelrushing.com'>photography</a>. Her name is Rachel and she&#8217;s  one of the most kind and gentle people I&#8217;ve ever met, and she&#8217;s also very hot and talented. One day, if/when God permits, we&#8217;ll start a family of our own, and we&#8217;ll team up and show those kids who&#8217;s the boss.</p>

<p>My faith is most definitely the strongest part of my being. It&#8217;s held securely in Christ, due to many things I&#8217;ve experienced and many things I haven&#8217;t. When his name is used for wrong purposes, that pisses me off. When his name isn&#8217;t used for the right purposes, that also pisses me off. I&#8217;m not a certain denomination, just a Believer.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m also a designer. A maker of things. Mainly things of the web, type and doodly persuasion, but also hand-made things like screenprints, books, and magical origami swans crafted from the hair of  rhinoceri. Rhinoceroses?</p>

<p>Do you remember back when I said I make magical origami swans? That was untrue. I said it to make you laugh. I also like to laugh, and make others laugh as well. I think I get it from my younger sisters who passed up the jeans from when we were kids. Yes. Jeans.</p>

<p>Beards. Personally, I&#8217;m not a beard, but I do have one, and have had several in my lifetime. Many years ago I only had hair on my chin and it was very stringy and about two inches long. I know, gross. But now it&#8217;s much better since I have a trimmer and a wife who likes my beard.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m trying to be a somewhat of a writer, but I&#8217;m not incredibly good at it yet, but I do talk a lot, and I think that is something. When I was a senior in high school, my english teacher told me to write how I spoke so that&#8217;s what I did all through college.</p>

<p>Oh yeah, college. Can&#8217;t forget those lovely years at <a href='http://art.latech.edu'>Louisiana Tech University</a>. I was an engineer for about ten weeks, until I realized I was really bored and didn&#8217;t know what anyone was talking about. Insert graphic design. Insert name change to “communication design.” Excel. Kind of. I mean, I was the average student - terrible and full of bad concepts. Somehow I got a job.</p>

<p>I was also in the band for four years in college and really loved it. Except for the fact that I never got to travel anywhere cause we didn&#8217;t have the best teams. One awesome thing about joining the band was my discovery of Kappa Kappa Psi, National Honorary Band Fraternity. I learned a lot with those guys. Being in ΚΚΨ gave me a lot of confidence and sometimes an edge over the other students. I also learned how to do step shows, party hops, and other nonsense. The ladies loved it. I think anyway.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m also a fan of <a href='http://teamcoco.com'>Conan O'Brien</a>. He&#8217;s hilarious and I hope to meet him one day. At this time, I&#8217;d also like to give a shout out to Spiderman, and you need to know that sometimes my thoughts end abruptly.</p>

<p>So, who am I? I am all of these things, composed by the experiences I&#8217;ve had and the happenings of others. Thanks be to God.</p>
