## Challenges

### Getting Content

Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Praeclare hoc quidem. Duo Reges: constructio interrete. Invidiosum nomen est, infame, suspectum. Quid iudicant sensus?

### Technical Difficulties

A few years ago I grew a lot, and by the end of the year, I was questioning many ideas, one of which was love. Although it sounds cheesy, I've learned an incredible amount about myself and others.

I started a Facebook group in Fall 2008 and asked friends and family if they thought love could be defined. If they thought they could do so, through a photo or story, I encourged them to post it. A few photos of children playing, old couples holding hands, and friends hanging out were uploaded, and some discussions cropped up about what it meant to be loved and to love in return.

After a short while of curating the Facebook group and noticing the potential for a meaningful website, <a href="http://canyoudefinelove.com">Can you define love?</a> was started, eventually evolving into what it is today, with hundreds of definitions.

### Collecting the Definitions

Most of the text-based definitions on the site have been submitted through email or the <a href="http://canyoudefinelove.com/submit">submission form</a> on the website, while the hand-written and video definitions are collected the old-fashioned way: asking strangers. Sometimes the initial "Hi, excuse me&hellip;" can be awkward, but one they hear what the goal is, they are (generally) eager to give their opinion.

Hundreds of definitions have been collected from people with all types of backgrounds and beliefs, and while most people have an opinion on love, ranging from the <a href="">faith-based</a> to <a href="">food-based</a> and <a href="">terrible clich&eacute;s</a> to <a href="http://canyoudefinelove.com/2012/08/21/i-spent-my-whole-life-wondering-what-was-wrong-with-me/">deeply personal</a>, some <a href="">believe love doesn't exsist</a> at all.
