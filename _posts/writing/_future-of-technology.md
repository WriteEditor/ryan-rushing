We don't have to remember how to spell words correctly, only correctly enough so spellcheck can recognize it. We ask search engines to find things for us, but we're easily pleased and usually only click the first link in the list. We use alerts and notifications to remind us to check Twitter or to call your sister for her birthday. Maps on devices give us an excuse for never remembering how to get anywhere.
