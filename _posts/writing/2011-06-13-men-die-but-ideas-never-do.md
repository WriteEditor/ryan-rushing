title: Men Die But Ideas Never Do

When I graduated from college in 2009, my father gave me what is one of my most treasured gifts, a KA-BAR pocket knife.

KA-BAR is the official knife of the United States Marine Corps, and when my dad graduated from boot camp, they gave him this one with his name inscribed on the blade. To this day, the knife still sits on the plaque in my parents' bedroom. When I was a kid, I remember looking at the knife, and thinking about how cool it was that my dad carried a giant one like that around. When other kids at school would say "My dad/uncle was in the (other branch of military)." I would usually scoff and/or laugh and reply with something like "My dad is a Marine, and has a 12 inch knife at the head of his bed." Then stare at them blankly.

So to receive a knife, a KA-BAR knife, that's so closely tied to a pivotal point in my father's life, was humbling. Although I had already known, on that day there was no doubt he was proud of me.

When I pulled the blade from its handle, I saw there was more to it. On the blade there was an inscription that read "Men die but ideas never do," and after a few unsuccessful moments trying to remember the phrase from some story he told me about the Marines,  I wondered where he got it from.

"I made it up. Well, I got some inspiration from other Marine sayings but basically made it up."

Now, most Marine Corps sayings are about being a soldier, being fearless, or just generally being a badass, and none of them are about accepting death. But this quote is different; it acknowledges that death will come, but the ideas will live on. When a father tells his son that he's going to die, that's not generally a good thing, but that was only the half of it. I am going to die one day, but until that day comes, keep going because those ideas, and the inspiration that comes from them, will live on.

My dad's imagination is way out there, and his storytelling abilities are better than any wizard in medieval folklore, but he isn't much of a pen-to-paper "writer". So when he told me he made up this phrase, I was more than impressed. Not necessarily with the phrase itself but what it meant to me. In these six words, he recognized what my life is about: spawning ideas and running with them. He knew that I'm trying to affect this world, and then he engraved the thought on a symbol that represents his own life-change, which actually set him on the path to become a father in the first place.

This gift symbolizes a commision passed down from my father to myself that states matter-of-factly "I believe in you. Go do your thing."

One day, I hope to pass it down to my son.

Thanks for believing in me Dad,
I love you.

Happy Father's Day.
