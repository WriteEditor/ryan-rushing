#Hand Lettering and Semantics

Many things start off as a hand drawn and eventually become vectorized things, but that vector file that looks like it was hand drawn is not hand drawn.

It may be distorted, it may be distressed or textured, but it's not drawn by your hand.

Originals are hand drawn, mechanical reproductions are not.
