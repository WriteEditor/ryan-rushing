excerpt: Google Reader has been retired, and that's totally okay. There are lots of other natural ways to find great content.

[Potluck](http://potluck.it) is a site where you post links, and your friends can comment on them. There's no status updates, no photos, only links. This idea [isn't](http://reddit.com) [new](http://digg.com) [at](http://news.ycombinator.com) [all](http://news.layervault.com), but [Obvious Corporation](http://obvious.com) (the people behind Branch and Medium) has made it a more fun, gamified experience.

Your feeds on Twitter and Facebook, and ironically enough Google+, are also a hotbed for interesting, relevant links. On Twitter, I may follow someone because they post interesting links or they write interesting content. I'm not following the site it's posted to, I'm following **the author** of it.

Which brings me to the demise of Google Reader and RSS feeds in general. The [official reason](http://googleblog.blogspot.com.au/2013/03/a-second-spring-of-cleaning.html) Google gave for retiring this beloved app is thus:

> While the product has a loyal following, over the years usage has 
> declined. So, on July 1, 2013, we will retire Google Reader.

That's pretty vague, but it seems like the reason the inbox-style article collection isn't as valuable is because of the other ways of collecting links and good content. 

Not only has the way we *discover* content changed, but the *content itself* has gotten better, and we have more of it than ever before. Places like [Svbtle](http://svbtle.com), [The Pastry Box Project](http://the-pastry-box-project.net/), and [Signal vs. Noise](http://37signals.com/svn/) are a few of my favorites, and I know when I go there I'm going to be reading high-quality articles. I don't need an RSS notification to tell me when they've written a new article, because I will either hear about it via [Sidebar](http://sidebar.io/), [Designer News](http://news.layervault.com), or through my various social media feeds.

However, if you still enjoy the notification of unread stuff, there are a [some](http://digg.com/reader) [alternatives](http://feedly.com) to Google Reader, but for me, the stress of the 237+ unread articles is more than I would like. If it's worth reading, I'll run across it another way.
