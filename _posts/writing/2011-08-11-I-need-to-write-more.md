####The first paragraph is referencing an old site, not the current version.

When I designed this version of ryan-rushing.com, I put the most recent post in a very prominent position on my home page in an effort to force my hand to paper and actually write down the ideas that have bouncing around in my brain. That didn&rsquo;t really didn&rsquo;t work as well as I&rsquo;d hoped, but since it&rsquo;s designed like this for now, I need to take avantage of it.

Initially, I wanted to write about the latest and greatest design amazingness in the world, some spiritually intense posts, and some personal stuff occasionally, but it turns out there is a lot of work and time needed to sculpt an idea into a coherent concept worth contemplating and conversing with your coworkers and cousins.

With practice, I believe good designers can make especially good writers, and so I needed to try to do this. I had to exercise this muscle. Excuses be gone. 

For this re-entry post, I had a few ideas, but none of them were fully formed. I became lazy and less interested as time passed, but since riding the train to work, I have an extra four hours a day to be awesome. There are several posts I&rsquo;m working on, none of which will throw the design community in a angry Twitter firestorm as if it were a redesign of news, but they are fun for me to write, which is the point.

Strangely enough, all those scribbles and scratches in my notebook actually ended up having a point: we should all write more.

Designers use colors, photographs, typography and other cool stuff to communicate all sorts of things, but what if we also used *wooordsss*. I know, I&rsquo;m mystical. Like Merlin.

I realize the designer as author concept isn&rsquo;t new, but the more and more I think about my personal need for expressing excitement through writing experiments (like alliteration, for example) I&rsquo;m convinced I do not do it enough. The words we use with our design can push it to another level, in the same way that the drippy blood font makes everything scary. 

You may be thinking I sound like a confused wombat in a wig, but that&rsquo;s by design. It&rsquo;s part of my world domination. Really, this post is less about convincing the world that we all need to write more and more about proving to myself that it can be done, hopefully much more frequently than it has been happening.  Join me on my journey!
