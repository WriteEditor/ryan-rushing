When I was invited to an ad network last year out of the blue, I was encouraged and motivated to write more. This meant someone was paying attention to what I was saying! Not only were they just *reading* my thoughts, but they actually thought my content was good enough to take ad space.

My writing had been discovered. I thought, "This is it! I can write stuff and post it to Designer News and Reddit and maybe I'll make a few extra dollars!"

As you may notice, there are no longer ads on my site.

Developing piles of cash was never a real goal with those ads, but I figured I would profilt more than the $13 dollars I actually made. In a year, I redesigned my site three times trying to figure out the best place for them, which cost me far more than $13 dollars in personal projects. I thought the ads would serve as a badge of honor for those checking out my site for the first time. 

"Okay, this guy has ads on his site. The content must be great. Here, let me tweet this article to my 10,000 followers. The rest of the world must know about this great content!"

Yeah, that definitely didn't happen.

I was apart of the ad network for the wrong reasons. I have no hate against them though, I had no issues with the network itself and the rep was nice as could be.
