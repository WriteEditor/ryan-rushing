#Magic

I'm fascinated with illusion. When it comes to the harmless ones like card tricks and optical trickery, I'm mystified. The idea that my brain can be hacked, to see something impossible, is exciting but also pretty scary. 

We're attracted to magic tricks because we have another world to compare it to, one where this trick we've witnessed is impossible. During those magical moments, we push logic and reason out of our minds. We know it's fake, but for the trick to work, we must suspend disbelief while we straddle the line between the fantasy world of mind-readers, women being cut in half, and disappearing animals and the uneventful world of cubicles, medical bills, and bosses.

We convince them it was impossible, yet it happened, and we use phrases like "you just had to be there," or "you wouldn't believe me if I told you." Our retelling of the story skews logic even more, and becomes an illusion in and of itself.

When it comes to new ideas, we become the magicians. With simple slight of hand, we convince the audience this is the pinnacle of where they are at. They. The believers. The ones who allow themselves to be overtaken by this new app, device, or product will spread the word near and far about its impossibility, which now exists in this world. We've crossed over and brought something into this environment that didn't exists before. Couldn't exist. When we compare this wonderful new, seemingly impossible, world to the previous one that didn't have the product, we don't want the trick to end. Because if

Harmless illusions are great. They get adrenaline flowing and blood pumping. You get to ask the question, "How did you do that?", and later tell others how this shouldn't have happened, and you'll say "I was watching the cup on the left whole time."

You thought you were paying attention, yet you were fooled, because on some level you wanted to be fooled.
