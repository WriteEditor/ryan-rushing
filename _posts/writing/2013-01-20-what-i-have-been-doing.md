#### I'm excited about my personal projects, and I thought I'd share the few holding my attention at the moment.

### Rachel Rushing ([rachelrushing.com](http://rachelrushing.com))###

My wife's out-dated site needs a drastic update, and I'm pretty sure it's broken in a lot of places. 

When I built it a couple years ago, it was my first responsive, fully Wordpress site, and many mistakes were made.  Also, when I designed the logo and identity for Rachel, which is based primarily on story-telling and connecting, I sincerely thought she needed it, but the truth is she doesn't *need* a logo. A professional, academic emotion, based around her work, should be the core of her identity, not a logo.

Rachel's artwork is much different than any other graphic design work, and her new site will focus on explaining her thought process, thereby giving it context. Right now she's creating anthotypes, using an antique process from the pigment of flowers and other plants. Once everything is said and done, you're left with a gorgeous, aromatic, textural work of art.

Ideally, you'd see her work in person in a gallery setting, but at the very least, her work deserves a different treatment on her website than a static, flat, scanned graphic. *Launch goal: early February*



### Miss-Lou Veteran's Village ([miss-louveteransvillage.com](http://miss-louveteransvillage.com))###

This is a non-profit organization my dad is founding, and I volunteered to help out. He's the business side of it, I'm the design side of it, and we're both the idea guys. So far, it's just us two.

At first, it'll simply be a job search site geared toward unemployed veterans, and eventually, far down the road, a brick-and-mortar trade school/rehabilitation center/housing for homeless vets will be built.

The idea was sparked by my dad's current job. He works for the State of Mississippi to find jobs for veterans, and as you may know, most government sites are pretty terrible to use. In some cases, he has to send people to several terrible websites, and in the end, these men and women are more confused than when they started.  

There are many plans in the works, but for now, we're focusing on the job-listing website part. *Launch goal: early March*

### Can you define love? ([canyoudefinelove.com](http://canyoudefinelove.com)) ###

This is my favorite and longest running personal project, which I've worked on my entire professional career. The current site and identity were developed around this time last year and launched on Valentine's Day, and since then, I've uploaded about 360 definitions with about 800 to go. Slowly, but surely, they are all going up.

By watching the analytics, I've learned a lot about how people use the site, and I see places to improve. Although I'm not working on a complete redesign like last year, there are a few different angles I'd like to approach, especially for searching and browsing the hundreds of love definitions. *Launch goal: early April*

### The Happy Factory ([wecreatehappy.com](http://wecreatehappy.com))###

Rachel and I absolutely needed to launch this site this summer, after working on it for a couple years. We did, and now we have to make more products. Also, we need to put some effort into marketing and advertising, which could easily be a full-time job in itself.

By May, I'd like to have more products for sale and some UX improvements live. *Launch goal: beginning of May*

### My Personal Work ###

I'm writing, reading, making improvements to this site, drawing lettering, and constantly keeping track of all ideas, not matter how big or small; there are lots of them.
