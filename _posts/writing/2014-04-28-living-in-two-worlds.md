The downside to living in a physical world and working in a digital one is spending all day clacking away on the keyboard, while having the distict feeling the work isn't "real".

When I was a kid, I took apart almost every electronic thing in my room, and occasionally I was able to piece the wreckage back together from the pile of parts which lay before me. Extra (or missing) pieces were common results of my curiosity, much to my parents' dismay.

A week before the first day of 7th grade,  I built a system out of string, pulleys, and curtains, to help me get dressed in the mornings. After the first attempt in a not-a-drill-get-dressed-before-school scenario, my creation failed miserably. I dismantled the invention, but not without a full understanding of why more people don't build auto-dressing units.

In high school, I built a "security" system with a trip wire, a plush football tied to the ceiling, a cued up tape of Nelly's E.I., and a stereo at full volume. At the request of my mom, my then 9 year old sister brought landry to my room, tripped the wire, sending the football into her face at the exact moment the tape deck played [the opening growl](http://youtu.be/mNaMR8AyeWc?t=26s) of E.I. I will admit, I was thrilled the system worked, even though Courtney's experience was collateral damage. Obviously, the true targets were my *other* sister, Ariel, and her sleepover attendees.

Another loud stereo inccident happened the first week of college when I integrated my alarm clock into my stereo (yes, the same one). Unfortunately, the first morning it went off, I left for marching band rehearsal between activating snooze and the alarm reawakening. The <abbr title="Resident Assistant">R.A.</abbr> thought the fire alarm activated, which was not fun for the rest of my floor.

These days, I build digital products and not as many [Rube Goldberg](http://rubegoldberg.com/) devices. 

As much as I love building things on the web, I miss tickering. I miss placing my fingers on moving parts and following the tension of a string, plucking it to set off a low, instrumental note.

There are ways I retain connection to the physical world while working. Both the watch on my wrist and clock on my computer are analog, and I take notes and sketch wireframes with a pen and paper. The ticking of my watch and scratching of my pen reminds me of the often forgotten third dimension where I exist. Perhaps more applicable to my work, this site is built in [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com), which has taught me new ways to play with digital toys. 

While I'm not one of them, many designers and developers found their way into this tangled web by way of Geocities or Angelfire. They were the fiddlers, playing until they got something right. I often wonder what it was like for newborn designers and developers to body surf into this career, purely driven by their amibition and curiousity.

It's no secrect we've entered into a new era to contruct on the web, where [tools are easy to come by](http://frankchimero.com/blog/no-new-tools/) and we're driven to socially media ourselves crazy. While you're out there carving your path, I urge you to explore and find new ways to connect this to that, and that to these. Use the command-line. Build something with an [Arduino Board](http://arduino.cc). Solve problems [manually](http://artequalswork.com/posts/manual-kerning/) instead of with plugins. Make a looping gif. Build inane projects that do one stupid thing. Open source them. Maybe someone will find a practical use, or maybe you'll discover you were right, and it is a waste of time. 

In the end, we're all humans crossing between two worlds, connecting to other humans -- whether by fiber-optics between computers or strings between cups.
