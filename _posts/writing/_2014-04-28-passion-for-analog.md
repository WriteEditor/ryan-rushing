I live in a physical world and work in a digital one. Many days my work doesn't feel "real".

When I was a kid, I took apart almost every electronic thing in my room, and occasionally I was able to recover the original from the pile of parts which lay before me. Extra pieces or missing parts were common results of my curiosity, much to my parents' dismay.

A week before the first day of 7th grade, using string, pulleys, curtains, and hangers, I built a system which helped me get dressed in the mornings. Doc Brown would've been proud, but after the first attempt of a real get-dressed-before-school scenario, I decided it wasn't worth it. 

In high school, I built a security system with a trip wire, a plush football tied to the ceiling, and a recorded tape of Nelly's EI. My littlest sister was the accidental perpetrator who set off the contraption, even though the target was my other sister and her sleepover attendees. 

Early in college I integrated my alarm clock into my stereo.  Unfortunately, the first morning it went off, I left for marching band rehearsal between activating snooze and the alarm reawakening. The dorm monitor thought the fire alarm was activated, which was not fun for the rest of my floor. 

These days, I build digital products, but I miss the tinkering. I miss placing my fingers on moving parts and following the tension of a string, plucking it to set off the low cello note.

My analog watch, written notes, and sketching wireframes are ways that I retain the connection to the physical world.
