### Our Search

I used to believe that churches should not look good. In fact, when my wife and I moved to Dallas in 2010, we were looking for churches that had an ugly building or sign, hopefully both. We thought if the church had a huge sign that scrolled and lit up, or if the building itself looked like a king&rsquo;s palace, they were not spending money appropriately. If we got past the sign and building and went inside, we would check out the ceiling and the stereo system, and if it was a stage rivaling U2&rsquo;s concert stage, we left before the service even started. We checked the handouts and other printed items, and if anything was well designed or used great photography, a red flag went up that pointed to bad spending.

After a while of doing this, it hit me hard. We had been incompletely judging these churches without knowing any of the people (or in some cases, their teaching). Although some of our guesses to their finances may have been correct, we were wrong to base the quality of these churches on their outward appearance. However, my wife and I were looking for a very specific type of church: less than 300 members, humble, active, not worried about increasing their size, had friendly people with a fun spirit, and we didn&rsquo;t want to settle until we found it. The other churches fit in some ways, not in others, and we wanted a place that had all of those things. (Side note: We found it, so if you need a church in the Dallas area, holla at me.)

### Make It Look Cool

Some of the large churches hire a designer or two to take care of all the visual aesthetics. The responsibility of creating or editing video and motion graphics, designing printed things, building a web presence, creating sermon slides, t-shirts, etc., may fall on one person, or a team of people. Although some churches have the resources to hire someone full-time to create these little flourishes for the church, I don&rsquo;t believe that a church needs someone to fill this role full-time, and it pains me to believe that outward appearance is of such importance to our modern houses of worship. When a church family decides they have a problem and they are going to use popular visual trends to solve it, this is a mistake, and is much like putting a golden ring in a pig&rsquo;s snout.

If the church has so much decorative work to be made, to the point of hiring a full-time designer, they should rethink the reason why so much of this work exists in their church. Is the church still the same without the banners, pamphlets, handouts, and motion graphics? If it&rsquo;s not, change now. Will it lose part of its family if the house and all its furnishings burned to the ground? If yes, the church needs a drastic change and should start with its heart, not with the proverbial paint on the building.
                
### Solve Problems

To be explicitly clear: I&rsquo;m saying church designers need to do more than make things pretty. That is not the sole reason for what we do. We are problem-solvers, and contrary to belief, your church has problems. All do. Designers can work with the church and help solve those problems. We can present the message in different ways, so that it reaches different people. We can tell people&rsquo;s stories. We can design programs to help the community. As designers, we can help.

A new logo or website, if purposefully designed, can tell a wonderful truth about who the church family is, and can be a huge help to those (like Rachel and I) who are looking for our church. In your design work, be honest, be purposeful. Bring to light the problems, doubts, and fears of God&rsquo;s people and work with others to discuss them. If you are a designer, this is an enormous responsibility. This is what you do, and it must be done.
                
### No Better or Worse

Whether you are the mega-church with many resources, or the small church without any, do not look down on each other. Ensure that your church is putting Christ first always, then (and only then) focus on displaying the appropriate personality of your family. We <em>should</em> offer the same idea, with a different twist. Rachel and I needed something small and casual, but our church is not better or worse than the church that&rsquo;s formal and has a large membership. Simply because a church has an interesting visual aesthetic, electric sign and many members, does not mean its lemonade is any better or worse than the church with the cardboard sign, who meets under the interstate.

Our job, as designers, is to tell the story of Christ and make him famous. Let&rsquo;s offer the same message of love, hope, compassion, and sacrifice. We are a part of the same body with different personalities.
