This year and for the first time ever, my wife and I are taking a different approach to Christmas. There is a misdirection of Christmas, and we haven't done much except for silently protesting in the form of a missing Christmas list.

This year we'll be focusing on something else. Thousands of churches have seen the love of Christmas sucked out of the season by shopping and wrapping excess, unnecessary gifts, and we've decided to participate in a movement that aims to bring Christmas along its original path that Christ paved with his birth.

The movement is called <a href="http://adventconspiracy.org/">Advent Conspiracy</a>.

Here are the four concepts behind Advent Conspiracy: worship fully, spend less, give more, and love all. These aren't simple at all. They are difficult to understand and act on, but for Christmas to thrive and grow in the way it was intended, we must adjust our understanding of the holidays in the best ways we know how.

When the first Christmas happened 2,000+ years ago, something happened that absolutely changed the world, and although we still celebrate that wonderful day, we tend to forget the reason Jesus was born in the first place. He came to help us, and leading by example, he showed us the proper way to help others.

Spend less on useless gifts that have no meaning. When you give gifts this year, sacrifice more than money. Sacrifice your time to find a wonderful, thoughtful gift that's needed, and give away the money you save to charities around the world and organizations in your community with a joyous heart. 

Finally, love. Love family, friends, co-workers, and the most difficult challenge of all, we must love our enemies.
