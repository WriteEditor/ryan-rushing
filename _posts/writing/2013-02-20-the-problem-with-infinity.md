### The Old Days
Historically speaking, making something meant it was tangible, but the idea of a created object is changing dramatically to include digital items. Having more resourses, such as time, money, and natural resources, means we can create more physical objects. When dealing with physical items, there's always a one-to-one trade: creating things demands resources, and creating lots of things demands lots of resources.

After objects are made, the concept of the one-to-one trade-off carries over into the business world when some form of currency is accepted for the object. You give me this, and I give you that. Simple. However, when it comes to digital products, there is the perplexing problem of *infinity*.

The written word, whether by printing press or by human hand, has been around for millenia. When Gutenburg invented the printing press in 1450s, he didn't change the fundamental limitations of phyics, however, he did increase the effenciecy of making a large number of physical items. More books, less time. After selling those books, they've been replaced by something else, and the one-to-one trade has happened again. Eventually I'll sell all my books and, if I want to sell more, I'll need to make more.

Now fast-forward a few years to the present day. Enormous libraries contain an unfathomable number of pages, covers, and letters holding vast amounts of information and stories, and yet, there is a limit to how many physical books can exist. Between the resources it takes to create books and the physical space it takes to store books, we are still faced with limits.

### Close Enough to Infinity 
In the digital world, space is cheap and abundant.  While Earth's available physical space is decreasing, the digital world seems to be expanding at break-neck speeds. (Much like our actual universe, funnily enough.) Whether we're talking about the [Cloud](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing), Internet, or just personal computers or mobile devices, all have a vast, fantastic space incomparable to physical space.

Our brains find the concept of infinity difficult to understand, and yet we're creating products that live solely in that world. We're trying to use the same one-to-one model we use with physical items to solve the problems we're encountering. 

and since there's no to digital items, we should approach the problem with a different model with entirely different variables.

### One Copy to Rule Them All
If our magnificent libraries decided to completely replace their entire collection with digital items, they could dramatically reduce the physical space they're currently occupying. If they convert all their paper materials into .ePub, .mobi, and PDF files and place them onto servers, you no longer need many amenities physical libraries need. 

In fact, digital libraries already exist. You don't need to drive there, you don't need to open a door to walk in, and most importantly, __there is no longer the physical limitation of one copy.__

If you go to a physical library, and check out a book, you now have that book. Although the content may be the same, the copy you're holding is unique; to break it down to an unneccsary level, each copy of a book is using its own set of molecules unique to it.  

Before the libriaian will allow you take the book home, you must give a promise to return the book. There's our one-to-one model at work. I give you this; you give me that.

However when we drop infinity into the mix, you can check out the book, leave, and the next person in line right behind you can check out the same book. And the next. And the next. All the way into infinity, and you'll never run out of any of that book. In fact, there are no "molecules" at play with digital items, which means they are the exact same item. Clones, if you will. Digitial clones.

###There is a Trade, Not One-to-One Though
Since the electronic universe exists *inside* this physical universe, we still have to deal with the physics of the situation. When a book is checked out of the physical library, remember there is more happening than simply a book getting checked out. The door opens when patrons walk in and out causing the heating and cooling system to work a little bit harder; the librarian may have to stop doing one task in order to check out your book; after you return the book, the shelver has to spend time to put the book back on the shelf in the right location.

All these little things that happen in a physical library are far less in a digital one, but they still exist. Servers still have to be cooled (probably more than a physical library), and when 10,000 people are downloading a book in an hour, the servers will work harder and heat up a little more, causing the cooling system to work harder.

####Disclaimer: I'm not a mathematician, nor do I know the intracies of servers. Please point out something if it's incorrect.
In the digital world, what is the magic number of books available to check out? At what point is a digital system challenged by the volume of users it can support? 

[#](drop in linear graph)

In a physical library the number is easy: one. Or perhaps, if you have two copies of the book: two. More can't be checked out because more don't exist. One-to-one.

[#](drop in curved graph)

At some point, this graph goes from vertical to horizontal, and in the circle is where the tipping point is. That's where the cost of traffic outweighs the cost of providing an infinite number of books. The same book can be downloaded x number of times, so long as the number of downloads prior to x doesn't exceed the cost of resources used.

###The Point
