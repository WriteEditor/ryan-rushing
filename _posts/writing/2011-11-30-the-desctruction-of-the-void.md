### I know what I need to do, but the nothingness is almost too strong. *Almost.*

I'm standing still, then pacing back and forth. Frustrated, I stop and stare, waiting for something to happen, but nothing changes. Just a piercing white emptiness before me. I've confronted the Void several times, but this time it's especially threatening. Time creeps by with a menacing consistency only rivaled by Death itself, and the White Void grows with each passing year.

*Tick*
           
I can hear a slight hum in the distance, but the more I become aware of it, the more it fades away and I feel more alone than ever before. Now searching for something to remind me of my humanity, I'm straining to hear anything. The silence is absolutely deafening, and now I starting to question my sanity.

*Tick*
            
The Emptiness taunts me with its vastness, and sensing my anguish, it sends ghostly minions that dance like the wind dances through the mountains. The shapes and colors of these spirits are tangible for a moment but gone the next. If these ghosts find it suitable to end my life now, it will not be too soon.

*Tick*
            
My arm twitches, and I'm reminded of my small companion who's always at my right hand, whose loyalty is unchanging. He steadies his weapon, an arrow, waiting for the right time to strike. When the timing is perfect, the arrow pierces the blank sky, and the banshees disappear with a final shrill. 

I draw a shape on the canvas and the void is destroyed.
