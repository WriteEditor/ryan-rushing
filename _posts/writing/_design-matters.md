#Design Matters

I don't explicitly think about design specifics often. I don't think about kerning or semantic markup or Photoshop techniques or the amazing things CSS3 can do.

When I carry-out an idea, I start with what I know, and if that doesn't cut it, I'll try to figure it out. If that doesn't work, I jump on the Internet machine to see what I can find out. I'm not sure if there's a right way to design.

My design thinking is the opposite of my experimental drawing style. I don't try to limit myself in either, though. But with drawing, I'm constantly looking for better ways to do stuff.

Maybe I'm just a different type of web designer.
