title: Did Apple steal the idea of automatic updates from the Harry Potter series?
excerpt: Overthinking the physics of spells and charms from Harry Potter using the iOS 7 app store and language.
---

#### Spoiler alert: there are spoilers about the Harry Potter series in the following article.

I tend to overthink the physics of fiction, which inevitably leads to my dissappointment when something doesn't quite add up. In this case, I was reading the books around then time when iOS 7 was announced with one particular feature: automatic updates from apps.

The Harry Potter series is among the greatest stories I've ever read. It's full of sacrifice, love, friendship, pain, hatred, and overcoming evil. Although it's classified as a kid's book, it's anything but. You should totally give it a read if you haven't.

I expect most are familiar with the story and know it's set in a world where wizards and witches exist all over the world, which remains largely hidden to "muggles", which are us non-magic folk. Before entering Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, which  witches and wizards from about 12 to 18 years old attended, they were sent a school supplies list.

Among the [books, uniform, and other equipment](http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Supply_list), the first-year students are required to bring a wand. Harry's first wand is made of Holly, has a core of a Phoenix feather, and is 11" long.

Early in the first book you'll learn one of the easiest charms is **Lumos**. When it's said, the tip of the wand lights up to create a sort of lantern or flashlight. The charm is used extensively by every character (of any experience level) in any low-light situation.

<small>Sound like something else?</small>

Later in the series you'll learn about a very difficult charm called the **Patronus Charm**, and activated by thinking a happy thought, making a circlular wand movement, and saying "Expecto Patronum". 

Reading the series coincidentally with the announce of iOS7, combined with my supernatural ability to over-think, I couldn't help but make the connection to the iOS apps and the app store.

By default there are apps on your iPhone, such as the calendar, email, photos, and web browser. <span class="sidenote">And you know, the actual phone app.</span>

There's also the app store, which has some incredibly useful apps. Some are free, some cost lots of money, and perhaps many of which will replace your default ones.

### The Wandernet

In some cases, certain wizards and witches are credited with inventing spells and charms, but that begs the question: how does the rest of the wizarding world use a newly invented spell?

Does the witch "upload" her spell to a sort of <s>App</s> Spell Store, which is then available for "downloaded" by other witches and wizards?

Remember the Patronus charm we talked about earlier? Dumbledore actually invented a way to send short messages with patronuses, and that was a common way for the Order of the Phoenix to communicate. Was this "invention" an update to the Patronus spell? Patronus version 2.0.0, perhaps?

The only plausible explanation I could come up with is that the wands were automatically updated with the latest version of any given spell, after the user had used, or downloaded, it.

### "The Wand Doesn't Have the Power &hellip;"

While dicussing this with my wife, she brought up a very good point. 

> It sounds like your theory leans on the wand having the power, but wizards could use other wizards wands and use a spell the first wizard never used. The wand doesn't have the power, the wizard has the power.

Okay, I have to give her full credit on this, because she blew my mind with her next thought.

> It's more like language.

When kids say words they don't understand, the word has no power, because they simply don't understand what they are saying. If fact, if the word carries consequences for being said, such as when saying a "bad word", we may simply laugh.

Every person who's capable of speech has the same access to stringing sounds together to create a word. When we say a word or phrase that we're not sure of it's meaning, it's usually because we're mimicing the original place we heard it. 

Kids curse because they've heard the sounds somewhere else before; they are mimicing someone else around them. It's only until they get older and hear the word more often and in different contexts that we learn the meaning of those words.

That's why one of the best ways to learn a new language is to be immersed in an environment where only that language is spoken. 

### Back to Hogwarts

In my Harry Potter Over-think of 2013, the "language" is spells, charm, and curses.

At one point, Harry tries to use one of the so-called "Unforgivable Curses" on Bellatrix. As she's running away, he points his wand and yells "Crucio!", but this has little effect on Bellatrix. Her response:

> You need to mean them, Potter! You need to really want to cause pain&hellip; to enjoy it&hellip; righteous anger won't hurt me for long&hellip;"

<small>Bellatrix to Harry, Order of the Phoenix (Book 5)</small>

In this example, Harry didn't know the full meaning of saying those words, and by performing the curse withing fully understanding it, it's full weight was not passed on.

### Not sure what to do now

I guess I need a conclusion? What's the main point?
