#Design or Pornography

A favorite conversation topic among designers seems to be whether something should be classified as design or art, and the logical extension is whether the creator was acting as a designer, or simply an artist. 

The label of artist in this context isn't considered desirable, when the designer label is the other option.

To break this down a little further, when work is considered art, and not design, the argument has little to do with looks, but rather the argument inherently revolves around *meaning*. Was thought, research, and study, poured into the final product? Many folks would call that design. Unless you're talking to Leonardo Da Vinci, the painter the Mona Lisa.
