*It's a parking lot for as far as I can see, over those two hills and around the curve. For some reason the idiot city planner thought two lanes here would work just fine.* "Anything would be better than this."

*Man, those drivers are flying on the other side. I wonder where they're going? What do they know&hellip;?* "Is there a three-car pile-up? Or is it construc&mdash;"

"YES!" *We're moving.*

*Why didn't I leave earlier? I can only get mad at myself though, I guess. Checking email and Facebook wasn't really worth this nonsense.*

*Oh hey we're moving again. Super. Another five feet.* I wave to no one, "REAL helpful, thanks."

*Twitter! I didn't check Twitter. Well at least I'll have something to do.*

"Don't care. Don't care. Complaining. Humblebr&mdash;"

*Oh whoops.* Pulling forward now. 

"Aaand unfollow you. So tired of RT contests."

*Oh look another 10 feet. Great. There's an intersection coming up, maybe I can turn off and take another route.*

"The Most Underused CSS3 Technique? Ok. Sure, I'll bite."

*Eh. Not that great.* "Not all designers underuse it."

*Shit. Now I'm in the intersection blocking this guy.* "Sorry dude!", as I apologetically wave.

*Must. Not. Look.* Shit, I looked. *Look away, look away. He's pissed. Whoa, like really pissed.* "Calm down, hombre. I'll be out out of your hair soon."

*Just what I needed. My light is red. His is green. Well there's nothing I can do now. Hopefully traffic will clear up and I'll be out of his way and he can cross.*

"Fucking hell!" **Another driver not paying attention to traffic blocks me.**

"I just want to cross the **FUCKING ROAD, YOU ASSHOLES, PAY ATTENTION!**"

Our obliviousness to the world around us can do as much damage to others as consiously causing harm. The result is the same.
