Yesterday was my first experience testing a site that I designed. (For these tests, we used [http://usertesting.com](http://usertesting.com)). The users followed a script with tasks, and as they tried to run through the script, they recorded their screens and articulated what they were thinking.

Watching the users interact with the site was humbling and quite odd for me. It was a very cool experience to see someone use a site, following the path you intend for them to take to find specific information.
