### The Old Days
The idea of a created object is changing dramatically. Historically speaking, that is before the digital and electronic world exploded, to make something meant we made one of it. With more resourses, more of that object will be made, but there is always a one-to-one trade-off: to make more things, more resources must be used. 

After an object is made, the concept of one-to-one carries over into the business world when currency (or another item of value) is accepted for the object. Even with money, we're still talking about a one-to-one trade-off. You give me this, and I give you that. Simple.

However, when it comes to digital products, there is the perplexing problem of [infinity](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinity). 

The history of books is probably the best example of this, so we'll start there. The printed word (whether by printing press or by human hand) has been around for millenia. When Gutenburg invented the printing press in 1806, he didn't change the fundamental limitations of phyics, but he did increase the effenciecy of making books.

Fast-forward a bunch of years to the present day. Enormous libraries all over the world have been built containing copies and copies of the world's most beloved classics and some not so beloved. An unfathomable number of pages, covers, and letters containing vast amounts of information and stories cover our world, and yet, there is a limit to how many physical books can exist. Between the resources it takes to create books and the physical space it takes to store books, we are faced with one major issue: physics.

### Infinity
No worries, friends. There is more to the story. We've created an entire world to store everything, and is this world, "space" is cheap. Where Earth's physical space is lessening, this new environment is expanding at break-neck speeds. (Much like our actual universe, funnily enough.) Some people call this inexpensive ever expanding world the [Cloud](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing), while others just call it the Internet, but whatever you call it, they both share the common characteristic of infinity. When you're not connected to the bigger universe (the Internet), there's a good change you're on the local level, but still living in the digital world.

Infinity becomes an issue because we've never experienced it before, and we're creating products that live solely in that world, which we're trying to use the same one-to-one model with physical items. Since there is no so-called limit to digital items, we should approach the problem with a different model.

### One Copy to Rule Them All
If the aformentioned libraries decided to completely replace their entire collection to digital form, they could dramatically reduce the physical space they're currently occupying. Drop all their .ePub, .mobi, and PDF files onto servers and you no longer need many amenities of a physical libray.

In fact, fully digital libraries already exist. You don't need to drive there, you don't need to open a door to walk in, and most importantly __there is no longer the physical limitation of one copy existing in the world.__

If you go to a physical library, check out a book, you have that book. Following the one-to-one model, you've given a promise to return the book, and you get to take home the book.

In the world of Infinity, you can check out the book, leave, and the next person in line right behind you can check out the same book. And the next. And the next. All the way into infinity, and you'll never run out of any of that book. Better yet, it doesn't take up any more physical space in the Infinite Library, because you're essentially duplicating the book every time someone checks it out.

###There is a Trade, Not One-to-One Though

Since the Internet exists under the umbrella of this limited universe. We still have to deal with the physics of the situation. When a book is checked out of the library there is more happening than simply a book getting checked out. The librarian may have to stop working to scan the book taking focus from some other task, the door opens when patrons walk in and out, causing the heating and cooling system to work that much harder
