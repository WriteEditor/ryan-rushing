In college I bought a black rain jacket. It wasn't warm, but it kept me dry and safe from the chilling wind. 

I saw it on my way to men's clothing section in the rear of the store. I noticed the dark water-resistant material hanging on a rack among a collection of tan sport coats, and I came to a halt. It was as if some wise man chose the black jacket, and on the way the cashier, passed the rack of sport coats, then was confronted by a demon.

"Your friends will make fun of you for wearing that shiny black fiasco," the demon probably said. "Leave the jacket here, and take home one of these classic, tan sport coats to fit in better."

Perhaps not a wise man at all, he opted for the sport coat, while giving myself the opportunify to learn from his mistakes.

Here I stood. Faced with the same decision. Buy the jacket, which I don't need, or surrender to the captivating sheen of the protective garment, which may leave me heartbroken in the end.

While the wandering businessman concluded a black lightweight rain jacket pales in comparison to a classy, tan, sport coat, I could not follow his lead. We were different men, facing different challenges. 

This jacket spoke to me, and I bought it.

The rain-jacket and I were inseperable. As soon as the wind picked up and the temperature dropped in early October, my guardian was encapsulting my body and came off only when I slept. For months, I was kept safe from swarms of rain drops and armies of slicing wind currents. 

I don't remember the last moment my defender and I had together. Looking through my bedroom one fateful morning, "I know I put you right here. Where *are* you?" I could not find it. It was lost. Did I leave it in my car? Girlfriend's apartment? Parent's house? I looked up and down, under and over, in closets and outside. Opened washing machines and through backpacks. 

It was gone, in secret, as if the Sport Coat Demon retreived his instrument. 

Maybe the demon placed it on another coat rack where it didn't belog, in another shop, where a kid who doesn't think he needs a black rain jacket, will soon realize he does.
