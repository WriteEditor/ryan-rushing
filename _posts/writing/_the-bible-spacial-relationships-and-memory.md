### This isn't really about the Bible
For Christians, knowing how to quickly locate verses in the Bible is important. Often in Sunday schools or church camps children will participate in Bible drills to practice putting the books of the Bible in order. When the pastor says open your Bible to Hebrews 11:1, we know to turn to the book of Hebrews, chapter 11, verse 1. 

Pretty simple, but if you're new to using the Bible, finding Hebrews may be a challenge and in a church full of furiously flipping pages, this can be quite nerve-wracking. No one wants to be the last person trying to find the scripture.

Thankfully, technology is coming to the rescue! With digital Bibles, finding information








The Holy Bible app is a very popular app on iOS devices and through the web the same information can be accessed on YouVersion.com.

Bible apps are all over the place and are widely used by Christians all over the developed world. Those with smartphones can open the Good Book and read any scripture they desire.

However, this unlimited access to information has a negative affect, which is that once you get used to using an electronic Bible, or any reference book for that matter, it's difficult to use the paper versions. 

Why? Because apps don't teach us where things are in the Bible, which is a very important, lesson learned as a child. We have Bible drills to name all the books of the Bible in order, and worse yet, we are having trouble memorizing things.

When you want to know something about food, you can search for food. Rather than reach deep inside your mind and pull in out.

Now that's really just the internet in general, but you get the idea.

A huge part of memorizing where verses are, is the spacial relationship of the surrounding environment. This is the same problem in a grocery store.
