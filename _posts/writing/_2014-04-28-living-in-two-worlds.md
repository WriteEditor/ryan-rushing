The downside to living in a physical world and working in a digital one is spending all day clacking on the keyboard, while having the distinct feeling the work isn't "real".

When I was a kid, I took apart almost every electronic thing in my room, and occasionally I was able to piece the wreckage back together from the pile of parts which lay before me. Extra pieces were common results of my curiosity, much to my parents' dismay.

A week before the first day of 7th grade,  I built a system out of string, pulleys, and curtains, to help me get dressed in the mornings. After the first attempt in a not-a-drill-get-dressed-before-school scenario, my creation failed miserably. I dismantled the invention, but not without a full understanding of why more people don't build auto-dressing units.

In high school, I built a "security" system with a trip wire, a plush football tied to the ceiling, a cued up tape of Nelly's E.I., and a stereo at full volume. At the request of my mom, my then 9 year old sister brought landry to my room, tripped the wire, sending the football into her face at the exact moment the tape deck played [the opening growl](http://youtu.be/mNaMR8AyeWc?t=26s) of E.I. I will admit, I was thrilled the system worked, even though Courtney's experience was collateral damage. Obviously, the true targets were my *other* sister, Ariel, and her sleepover attendees.

Another loud stereo inccident happened the first week of college when I integrated my alarm clock into my stereo (yes, the same one). Unfortunately, the first morning it went off, I left for marching band rehearsal between activating snooze and the alarm reawakening. The <abbr title="Resident Assistant">R.A.</abbr> thought the fire alarm activated, which was not fun for the rest of my floor.

These days, I build digital products and not as many [Rube Goldberg](http://rubegoldberg.com/) devices, I'm still Frankensteining technologies together to purely learn how it works.

My tools are not string and stereos turned to full volume anymore, but I've grown into HTML, Sass, and jQuery. I've learned how to use Git effectively, and how deployments work in large distrubuted systems. I've worked on Ruby on Rails applications and the pains and joys of the asset pipeline. I've witnessed how a few lines of JavaScript, to one page of an app, can trigger an increase of thousands of dollars in revenue **a month**, eventually affecting which [side-project I do at home]({{site.url}}/work/independent).

I miss placing my fingers on moving parts and following the tension of a string, plucking it to set off a low, instrumental note, but as the construction crew to the 21<sup>st</sup> century, we cannot be oblivious to the nature of how our work is connected to everything else, which supports it.
