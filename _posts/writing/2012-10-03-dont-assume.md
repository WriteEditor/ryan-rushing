I once saw a homeless guy give a burrito to another homeless guy, and a few minutes later give another burrito to someone else. My misconception that all homeless people were out for themselves was blown out of the water. The idea that they were less fortunate because they had less money, left my mind.

In design, it's important for us not to assume anything. We can't guess what others will do, because people surprise us. They will do something unexpected, and if our decisions were based on personal preference or bad research, we'll be caught off guard. I try not to assume when it comes to design. It's not really about being awesome, it's about paying attention.
