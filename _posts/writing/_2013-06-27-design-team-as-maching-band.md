excerpt: Being a part of a design team can be a challenge if your role has been forgotten. Just as in marching band, there are some parts that play the melody and some parts that play the harmonies.

When I was in marching band, I wouldn't call myself the best trumpet player. The best players, usually the 1st trumpets, knew advanced music theory and could spit out difficult scales like the D&#9837; Major scale when prompted. They could untangle written notes into screaming riffs of delightful energy, flawlessly executed under-pressure. 

But I was not that player. In high school, our band went through five directors in three years, and I gave up my senior year. After a friend convinced me to try out for college band ("'cause it seemed fun."), I took lessons that summer, and became barely proficient enough to play in the 3rd trumpet section in the university's marching band. 

The lower notes I could play well and confidently, and in fact, my [embouchure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embouchure) was well-suited to play these lower notes with lots of volume. I couldn't play the high Cs and Gs (I'm talking **way** up there on the staff) like the 1st trumpets could, and frankly, I didn't want to. Our 1st trumpet players worked hard for many years, developed their chops, and studied, with the intention of one day becoming talented, leading trumpet players. They were incredibly good mucisians and rightly recieved lots of attention for it. Although I never wanted their job, I certainly admired their abilities and passion.

As you can probably guess, the 1st trumpets were first to get solos, and their music was composed of ridiculously high-notes and complicated rhythms. My people, who I affectionatly called the "bass line of the trumpet section", played solos less often than seeing a blue moon, andthe music was made up of slower notes, usually on the middle of the staff and below. We didn't exactly play the common notion of high-energy trumpet music.

In marching band, the third trumpets' role was to support the main melody. While the first trumpets played the role of the primary voice, the second and third sections played the harmonies that danced in tension with the melody. The way the music was structured was to enhance the band's *whole* sound, not one section or part, and unless you were trained in music, you may not be able to point out the trombone sounds or the saxophone riffs while we were playing, but I can assure you, you'd know if they stopped playing. With no foundation for the first trumpets to stand on, their earsplitting screams would be as desirable as nails on a chalkboard.

As professional designers on a team, we can forget that we have specific jobs to do. We see the first trumpets making incredible work and getting tons of recognition. They're given solos left and right, while many others are seemingly left in a supporting role. However, without ground to stand on, the delicate composition falls apart. Harmony is important for balance, and without some players falling back to provide support, the "music" becomes nothing but noise.

For the next four years, I did my duty as a 3rd trumpet player, and over time, I became a noticably better musician.
