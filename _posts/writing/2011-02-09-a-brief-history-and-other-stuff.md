My name is Ryan Paul Rushing. "Ryan" means little king, and "Paul" means humble. Basically, my name means "Little humble king who is always in a hurry."

I was born several years ago in a small town in Louisiana, known as Vidalia. (No. Not the place where Vidalia Onions come from. Stop asking.) I absolutely love my family, and am thankful for every moment I spend with them.

I'm married to an amazing artist who specializes in <a href="http://rachelrushing.com">photography</a>. Her name is Rachel and she's  one of the most kind and gentle people I've ever met, and she's also very hot and talented. One day, if/when God permits, we'll start a family of our own, and we'll team up and show those kids who's the boss.

My faith is most definitely the strongest part of my being. It's held securely in Christ, due to many things I've experienced and many things I haven't. When his name is used for wrong purposes, that pisses me off. When his name isn't used for the right purposes, that also pisses me off. I'm not a certain denomination, just a Believer.

I'm also a designer. A maker of things. Mainly things of the web, type and doodly persuasion, but also hand-made things like screenprints, books, and magical origami swans crafted from the hair of  rhinoceri. Rhinoceroses?

Do you remember back when I said I make magical origami swans? That was untrue. I said it to make you laugh. I also like to laugh, and make others laugh as well. I think I get it from my younger sisters who passed up the jeans from when we were kids. Yes. Jeans.

Beards. Personally, I'm not a beard, but I do have one, and have had several in my lifetime. Many years ago I only had hair on my chin and it was very stringy and about two inches long. I know, gross. But now it's much better since I have a trimmer and a wife who likes my beard.

I'm trying to be a somewhat of a writer, but I'm not incredibly good at it yet, but I do talk a lot, and I think that is something. When I was a senior in high school, my english teacher told me to write how I spoke so that's what I did all through college.

Oh yeah, college. Can't forget those lovely years at <a href="http://art.latech.edu">Louisiana Tech University</a>. I was an engineer for about ten weeks, until I realized I was really bored and didn't know what anyone was talking about. Insert graphic design. Insert name change to “communication design.” Excel. Kind of. I mean, I was the average student - terrible and full of bad concepts. Somehow I got a job.

I was also in the band for four years in college and really loved it. Except for the fact that I never got to travel anywhere cause we didn't have the best teams. One awesome thing about joining the band was my discovery of Kappa Kappa Psi, National Honorary Band Fraternity. I learned a lot with those guys. Being in ΚΚΨ gave me a lot of confidence and sometimes an edge over the other students. I also learned how to do step shows, party hops, and other nonsense. The ladies loved it. I think anyway.

I'm also a fan of <a href="http://teamcoco.com">Conan O'Brien</a>. He's hilarious and I hope to meet him one day. At this time, I'd also like to give a shout out to Spiderman, and you need to know that sometimes my thoughts end abruptly.

So, who am I? I am all of these things, composed by the experiences I've had and the happenings of others. Thanks be to God.
