title: Design Team as Marching Band

excerpt: Being a part of a design team can be a challenge if your role has been forgotten. Just as in marching band, there are some parts that play the melody and some parts that play the harmonies.

In my university's marching band the most skilled trumpet players were the first trumpets. They were expected to know advanced music theory and obscure scales in difficult keys. They could untangle complex rhythms into screaming riffs of delightful energy, and flawlessly execute under pressure. Our first trumpet players worked hard for many years by developing their chops and studying, with the intention of one day becoming exceptional, leading trumpet players. They were incredibly brilliant mucisians and rightly recieved lots of attention.

I was not that player. In high school, our band went through five directors in three years, and I dropped out my senior year. Music was interesting, more like a puzzle begging to be figured out than a passion, but after a friend convinced me to try out for the university's band ("because it seemed fun"), I decided to take lessons to make up for my lackluster high school music education. After the summer ended, I was proficient enough to play for Louisiana Tech's Band of Pride in the third trumpet section. My people, who I affectionatly called "the bass line of the trumpet section", played solos less often than seeing a blue moon, and the music wasn't technically challenging.

While the first trumpet section sang the melodic voice, the second and third sections played the harmonies that danced in tension with the melody. The music was structured to enhance the band's *whole* sound, rather than one section or part. The trombones or saxophone riffs may be noticeable to the trained ear, and they were especially noticeable if they stopped playing. With no foundation for the melody to stand on, the first trumpets' sounds would be as desirable as nails on a chalkboard.

Of course, the halftime show is a whole other monster. In most shows, every body on the field is relevant. Each player must consider the way they holds their instrument, take steps, and turn. Trust your fellow bandmates, and especially those immediately surrounding you. If things start falling apart during the halftime show, go with it; if the entire row is ten yards off, and you stand in the exact right spot rom practice, you're the one in the wrong, *because* you're sticking out.

As professional designers on a team, we can easily forget we have specific jobs to do. We see the first trumpets making incredible work and getting tons of recognition. They're given solos left and right, while many others are seemingly left in a supporting role. However, without ground to stand on, the delicate composition falls apart. Harmony is important for perfect balance, and without some players falling back to provide support, the "music" becomes nothing but noise.

For the next four years, I did my duty as a 3rd trumpet player, and over time, I became a noticably better musician.
