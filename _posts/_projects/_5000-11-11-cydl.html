    <h3>Background</h3>
    <p>
        A few years ago I grew a lot, and by the end of the year, I was questioning many ideas, one of which was love. Although it sounds cheesy, I've learned an incredible amount about myself and others.
    </p>

    <p>
        I started a Facebook group in Fall 2008 and asked friends and family if they thought love could be defined. If they thought they could do so, through a photo or story, I encourged them to post it. A few photos of children playing, old couples holding hands, and friends hanging out were uploaded, and some discussions cropped up about what it meant to be loved and to love in return.
    </p>

    <p>
        After a short while of curating the Facebook group and noticing the potential for a meaningful website, <a href="http://canyoudefinelove.com">Can you define love?</a> was started, eventually evolving into what it is today, with hundreds of definitions.
    </p>


    <h3>Collecting the Definitions</h3>
    <p>
        Most of the text-based definitions on the site have been submitted through email or the <a href="http://canyoudefinelove.com/submit">submission form</a> on the website, while the hand-written and video definitions are collected the old-fashioned way: asking strangers. Sometimes the initial "Hi, excuse me&hellip;" can be awkward, but one they hear what the goal is, they are (generally) eager to give their opinion.
    </p>
    <p>
        Hundreds of definitions have been collected from people with all types of backgrounds and beliefs, and while most people have an opinion on love, ranging from the <a href="">faith-based</a> to <a href="">food-based</a> and <a href="">terrible clich&eacute;s</a> to <a href="http://canyoudefinelove.com/2012/08/21/i-spent-my-whole-life-wondering-what-was-wrong-with-me/">deeply personal</a>, some <a href="">believe love doesn't exsist</a> at all.

        <p>
            Red is ubiqutious when speaking about love, and since I was tyring to avoid clich&eacute;s, green was chosen as the primary color used throughout the life of the project. Green represents growth, harmony, and alternatively, can relate to envy and, in the United States, money.

        <p>
            The first logo was created quickly as a college student, and aside from the color, lacked a thought-out concept. The "heart mark," as I started calling it, worked well as a primary icon, however the URL-as-logo was not working well as a mark, nonetheless it pointed people directly to the website (when not already there), without question.
        </p>
        <p>
            The site itself, not shown here, was the simpliest customization of a Wordpress site I could get away with; only the logo and colors were altered. At the time, I knew very little about developing with Wordpress and needed something quickly. This version of the site and logo stayed up for about a year, while definitions were collected.

            The primary objective for the second redesign was to create a cohesive identity system, to be more friendly and approachable. The color pallete remained largely unchanged, however the typography in the logotype receieved a major face-lift.
        </p>
        <p>
            Using a slightly-altered Caecilia set in lowercase for the logo was a huge emotional difference from the caps-locked "CAN YOU DEFINE LOVE?" set in Univers, and was certainly a needed change. (I'm sorry I yelled at you.) The "heart mark" itself was redrawn to remove the dependancy of the .com in the logo, and rather became a one-color icon that could stand on its own.
        </p>
        <p>
            One success in this second version was the home page, which asked the all-important question and "Tell me," with an area below for emailing text-based defintions. Becase of this strong call to action, I received about ten emails a day with defintions and stories to publish, however I didn't build an effective system for displaying textual defintions, so they were banished to the blog.

            Aside from the blog, this version leaned on a custom built system for uploading and displaying defintions. It was difficult to maintain and use, but it did get me excited to learn enough so I could re-build the site from the ground up in Wordpress, which I did.

            Both the branding and website were redesigned to further the approachability we accomplished in version two, and to extend the concept even further this time around, a strong human element was added in both the logo and in the details of the site.

            Aside from the blog, this version leaned on a custom system for uploading and displaying defintions built by a friend. Although it was difficult to maintain and use, it was the best solution at the time. It also made me excited to learn enough so I could re-build the site from the ground up in Wordpress, which I did.
