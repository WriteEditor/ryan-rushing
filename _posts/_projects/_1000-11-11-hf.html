The Happy Factory is a creative venture between my wife, Rachel, and I. We screenprint, make books, and whatever else strikes our fancy, then sell them online. All products are limited edition, and once they are sold out, they wonâ€™t be made in the same way again.

The branding concept mixes the human touch with industrial precision, and the site is meant to evoke a feeling of a large factory with huge windows, which illumate the machines with floods of natural light.
