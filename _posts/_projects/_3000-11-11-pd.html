				Peeper’s is a luxury eyewear seller in Dallas and has been in business for over 35 years, and they want to personally work with customers to make sure the best frame has been chosen for the wearer. To do so, it’s important that the customer makes a call or visits the shop. In a world where online shopping is king, the folks at Peeper’s believe the best service revolves around personal interaction.

				For the redesign, the contact information needed to be highlighted; this is the most important piece of information on the site. After calling, the ideal next step for shoppers is visiting, so the site needed to give off the same feeling of the Peeper’s store itself. The colors, architectural elements, and size of the shop are all pulled into the design of the website to give a sense of familiarity and comfort.

				Finally, a mobile design was essential, as many of Peeper’s customers use smartphones to find the next place to stop while shopping in the Highland Park Village area.
