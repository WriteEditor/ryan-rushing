# My Personal Site

[My site](http://ryan-rushing.com) is built on [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com), [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/) (using [Compass](http://compass-style.org), and [Gridset](gridsetapp.com).

### Jekyll (http://jekyllrb.com)

I'm not using Github Pages for my site yet, because honestly, I haven't looked very far into it. Once Jekyll is up and running, it compiles all the files into static HTML files in one directory. For now, I'm uploading the contents of that directory manually via FTP or SSH.

I'm not committing the compiled directory anymore (I was in the past) because there were major conflicts every time I merged from one branch to another.

### Gridset (http://gridsetapp.com)

From the team at Mark Boulton Design, comes Gridset. This app is great, because it allows you construct your grid based on your content. As great as Bootstrap, Foundation, and many other frameworks are, they work the opposite direction: forcing you to fit your content in a predetermined grid.

In my site, I'm using Gridset's Sass mixins and functions to build the grid, rather than the HTML classes. (Actually, if you go back a few commits, you'll see the HTML classes).

### Sass (http://sass-lang.com) + Compass (http://compass-style.org)

I'm still new to Sass and Compass, but from looking at the Gridset files, I learned a lot. Mostly I'm just nesting, breaking into smaller files, and some variables here and there. Nothing huge.

## Publicly Designing/Developing

I'm putting my site on Github to keep me accountable, and to become a better front-end developer and designer. This probably doesn't need to be said, but if you see some code you like, borrow away.

Finally, if you have critique, I'm all ears. If you have any questions about what I'm doing, feel free to [contact me](get@ryan-rushing.com).

**Note:** I had major problems in the beginning when learning Git and had to do some weird stuff to get my files back on track. The "this is the correct stuff, omg" commit message is when that was happening.
