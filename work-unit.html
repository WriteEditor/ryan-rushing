		<h4>Overview</h4>
		<p>The <abbr title="Interactive Learning Objects">ILO</abbr>s are game-like animations in the courses.</p>

		<h4>Goals</h4>
		<ul>
			<li>Update the assets of the animations.</li>
			<li>Retain teaching function of the animations.</li>
			<li>Introduce active decision-making where there is only a passive experience.</li>
			<li>Must especially consider the experience on mobile devices.</li>
			<li>Built with open technologies, such as HTML, CSS, JS</li>
		</ul>				

		<h4>Challenges</h4>
		<ul>
			<li>I've never designed an animated interface before this.</li>
			<li>Leading a project is a new experience for me.</li>			
			<li>When starting the project, I was a JavaScript noob. Like, bigtime. (I've worked with experts, both contracted and internal.)</li>
