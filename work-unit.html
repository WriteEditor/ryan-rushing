			<h2 class="fade-4">Peeper&rsquo;s</h2>
			<p>
				<a href="http://peepersdallas.com/">Peeper&rsquo;s</a> is one of the oldest (if not <em>the</em> oldest) boutique luxury eyeglass shops in Dallas,  located in <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&source=embed&hl=en&geocode=&q=64+Highland+Park+Village,+Dallas,+TX&aq=0&sll=32.836941,-96.806717&sspn=0.010529,0.022101&vpsrc=0&ie=UTF8&hq=&hnear=64+Highland+Park+Village,+Dallas,+Texas+75205&ll=32.836941,-96.806717&spn=0.010529,0.022101&t=m&z=16">Highland Park Village</a>. They do not deal in bulk nor sell online, but rather, they make expert recommendations based on the individual. Also, when you bring your prescription in, Peeper&rsquo;s actually grinds the lenses in-house to fit your frames perfectly.

			<p>
				As someone who <a href="/work/independent/">appreciates handmade stuff</a>, I thought that was the coolest thing; apparently not many eyeglass shops do that anymore. They were an absolute joy to work with.

			<h2 class="fade-4">John DeGroote</h2>
			<p>
				<a href="http://johndegroote.com/">John Degroote</a> is a trustee, mediator and arbitrator in Dallas, and has worked on impressive high-profile cases. He also speaks and has <a href="http://johndegroote.com/resources.php">lots of resources</a> available for download. The most difficult part of this project was the art direction for the photos, but after a while, we finally got what we needed.
			</p>
			<p>
				I should also note I didn&rsquo;t implement the final content for the launched site; there have been a few design/front-end dev changes, some for the better, since I had my hands in it.

			<h2 class="fade-4">Woot!</h2>
			<p>
				Although, the internal team at Woot! is largely responsible for the current site, we were consultants for years, discussing everything from technical implementation details, to game ideas, to viral video stuff. We covered it all, and it was a blast.
			</p>
			<p>
				Fun story: while in a meeting several years ago with the Woot!/Amazon leadership, they revealed their plan for the deal events, but they needed a name for it. I whispered &ldquo;Woot plus&rdquo; to my co-worker; it was a bit of a joke since Google+ was a new thing. I don&rsquo;t want to say I&rsquo;m responsible for the name, but&hellip;

			<h2 class="fade-4">Fine Dining, a Clear Menu experiment</h2>
			<p>
				In addition to client work, we also made internal stuff, and one such experiment was <a href="http://clearmenu.unitinteractive.com">Clear Menu</a>. Restaurant menus on the web are notoriously bad, so we set out to show what menus <em>could</em> look like using modern web technologies.
			</p>

			<p>
				I chose to develop a <a href="http://clearmenu.unitinteractive.com/fine-dining/">fine dining menu</a> (admittedly, so I could do some fancy <a href="/work/independent/">lettering</a>) and show only select items. What about prices? If you have to ask, well you probably can't afford my restaurant anyway. <i>flies away on gold-plated hovercraft</i>

			<h2 class="fade-4">Unify (customer support)</h2>
			<p>
				While doing client work, consulting with Woot!, and building internal projects, I was also the primary customer support specialist for <a href="http://unify.unitinteractive.com">Unify</a>, which taught me a lot about listening to the needs of users. Experiencing this direct connection changed how I worked on every subsequent project.
