			<h2 class="fade-4">letterforming</h2>
			<p>
				I&rsquo;ve been into lettering and calligraphy since about sophomore year of college when I was cheap and didn&rsquo;t understand the value of solid typefaces and well-constructed fonts.
			</p>
			<p>
				Until recently I&rsquo;ve only worked in two-dimensions, but <a href="http://dribbble.com/shots/1466132-Mightier-sculpture">discovering that third</a> one has been a carousel of emotions. Check out more lettering on <a href="http://dribbble.com/ryanrushing">Dribbble</a>. Or don&rsquo;t, whatever.

			<h2 class="fade-4">Read-Rite Market</h2>
			<p>
				<a href="http://blogs.dallasobserver.com/mixmaster/2013/07/read-rite_market.php">The Read-Rite Market</a> was an all-day event celebrating the written word the social practice of reading. My wife and I worked with <a href="http://oilandcotton.com">Oil and Cotton</a> to create a logo for the occasion, and we also live-printed the official posters.
			</p>

			<p>
				Also, not long ago my wife and I rebranded/renamed ourselves and are now known as <a href="http://instagram.com/variousmfg">Various Mfg Co</a>; formerly we were known as We Create Happy. (New site coming soon.)

			<h2 class="fade-4">Can you define love?</h2>
			<p>
				<a href="http://canyoudefinelove.com">Can you define love?</a> is my longest-running personal project (since 2009). It <a href="https://dribbble.com/ryanrushing/projects/25129-Can-you-define-love">has taken many forms</a>, but has always been a collection of love definitions provided by people I interview and passers-by on the Internet.
			</p>
			<p>
				The current, and most logical, iteration is now on Tumblr (using a free theme). In the past I spent lots of time on the web development/design, and paid little respect to the content, but since Tumblr is largely accessed through users&rsquo; dashboard, it gives me no excuse to misdirect my attention back to the Look and Feel&trade;.

			<h2 class="fade-4">North Point Christian Church</h2>
			<p>
				<a href="http://npcc.cc">North Point</a> is a small, simple church in Old Town Lewisville, TX. Before the rebrand, there were several inconsistencies among the site and various logos, which didn&rsquo;t match the spirit of the church family.
			</p>
			<p>
				I have strong feelings on <a href="/writing/2012/02/19/on-church-design/">designing for churches</a>, but in this case the work was necessary. This logo was listed on Church Relevance as a <a href="http://churchrelevance.com/resources/top-church-logos/">top church logo</a> which is a thing apparently.
