				I've been into lettering and calligraphy since about sophomore of college when I was cheap and didn't understand the value of solid typefaces and well-constructed fonts.
			</p>
			<p>
				Until recently I've only worked in two-dimensions, but discovering that third one has been a carousel of emotions. Check out more lettering on <a href="http://dribbble.com/ryanrushing">Dribbble</a>. Or don't, whatever.

		<div class="info fade-5">
			<p>
				<a href="http://npcc.cc">North Point</a> is a small, simple church in Old Town Lewisville, TX. Before the rebrand, there were a handful of inconsistent logos, which didn't match the spirit of the church family, and the site had the same problems.

			<p>
				I have strong feelings on <a href="/writing/2012/02/19/on-church-design/">designing for churches</a>, but in this case the work was necessary. This logo was listed on Church Relevance as a <a href="http://churchrelevance.com/resources/top-church-logos/">top church logo</a> which is a thing apparently.
