				The <a href="http://bookstore.kalkomey.com">Bookstore</a> is where you can get digital versions of our handbooks and student manuals covering boating, hunting, and handgun safety. They match our printed publications used in classrooms.

				The homepages of <a href="http://boat-ed.com">Boat Ed</a>, <a href="http://hunter-ed.com">Hunter Ed</a>, etc. were in need of some love to align with our design, front-end development, and SEO guidelines. The project was fairly straightfoward, and the hardest part was organizing all the new content.

				Most of the work we do isn&rsquo;t full-fledged redesigns, but rather, we build on small, incremental changes over time, like with the shopping cart example above.

				The Agile (Scrum) framework, user testing, and product focus drives our working methods. Here&rsquo;s an example of the evolution of our footer, and can be seen on <a href="http://boat-ed.com">any</a> <a href="http://hunter-ed.com">course</a> <a href="http://bowhunter-ed.com">page</a>.
