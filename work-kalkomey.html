			<p>
				The interactive learning objects are sprinkled throughout our courses and provide an alternate way for students to learn the content.
			</p>
			<p>
				I lead this project&mdash;wow that&rsquo;s great to type&mdash;and I work with our subject-matter experts and design, development, and content teams on everything from concepting to design to execution.

			<p>
				They can be viewed in the course or in a state&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.boat-ed.com/texas/studyGuide/10104501">study guide</a>. (The ones marked &ldquo;animation&rdquo;.) This project is far from complete, we&rsquo;re only just beginning.

			<p>
				The <a href="http://bookstore.kalkomey.com">Bookstore</a> is where you can get digital versions of our handbooks and student manuals covering boating, hunting, and handgun safety. They match our printed publications used in classrooms.

			<p>
				Through the power of infinity, you can enjoy perusing laws and regulations at any time, until your battery dies.

			<p>
				The homepages of <a href="http://boat-ed.com">Boat Ed</a>, <a href="http://hunter-ed.com">Hunter Ed</a>, etc. were in need of some love to align with our design, front-end development, and SEO guidelines. The project was fairly straightforward; the hardest part was organizing the new content.

			<h2 class="fade-4">Various module redesign</h2>
			<p>
				Most of the work we do isn&rsquo;t full-fledged redesigns, but rather, we build on small, incremental changes over time.
			</p>

				The Agile (Scrum) framework, user testing, and product focus drives our working methods. Here&rsquo;s an example of the evolution of our footer, and can be seen on <a href="http://boat-ed.com">any</a> <a href="http://hunter-ed.com">course</a> <a href="http://bowhunter-ed.com">page</a>.
