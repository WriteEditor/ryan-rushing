			<h4>Kalkomey</h4>
			<p>
				The homepages of <a href="http://boat-ed.com">Boat Ed</a>, <a href="http://hunter-ed.com">Hunter Ed</a>, etc. were in need of some love to align with our design, front-end development, and SEO guidelines. The project was fairly straightforward; the hardest part was organizing the new content.

			<h3>Educational games</h3>
			<h4>Kalkomey</h4>

			<p>
				The interactive learning objects are sprinkled throughout our courses and provide an alternate way for students to learn the content.
			</p>
			<p>
				I lead this project&mdash;wow that&rsquo;s great to type&mdash;and I work with our subject-matter experts and design, development, and content teams on everything from concepting to design to execution.

			<p>
				They can be viewed in the course or in a state&rsquo;s study guide.

				The <a href="http://bookstore.kalkomey.com">Bookstore</a> is where you can get digital versions of our handbooks and student manuals covering boating, hunting, and handgun safety. They match our printed publications used in classrooms.

			<h3>Iterative work</h3>
			<h4>Kalkomey</h4>
			<p>
				Most of the work we do isn&rsquo;t full-fledged redesigns, but rather, we build on small, incremental changes over time.
			</p>
			<p>
				The Agile (Scrum) framework, user testing, and product focus drives our working methods. Here&rsquo;s an example of the evolution of our footer, and can be seen on <a href="http://boat-ed.com">any</a> <a href="http://hunter-ed.com">course</a> <a href="http://bowhunter-ed.com">page</a>.

			<h3>Fine Dining</h3>
			<h4>Unit Interactive</h4>

			<p>
				In addition to client work, we also made internal stuff, and one such experiment was <a href="http://clearmenu.unitinteractive.com">Clear Menu</a>. Restaurant menus on the web are notoriously bad, so we set out to show what menus <em>could</em> look like using modern web technologies.
			</p>

			<p>
				I chose to develop a <a href="http://clearmenu.unitinteractive.com/fine-dining/">fine dining menu</a> (admittedly, so I could do some fancy <a href="/work/independent/">lettering</a>) and show only select items. What about prices? If you have to ask, well you probably can't afford my restaurant anyway. <i>flies away on gold-plated hovercraft</i>

			<h3>John Degroote</h3>
			<h4>Unit Interactive</h4>

			<p>
				<a href="http://johndegroote.com/">John Degroote</a> is a trustee, mediator and arbitrator in Dallas, and has worked on impressive high-profile cases. He also speaks and has <a href="http://johndegroote.com/resources.php">lots of resources</a> available for download. The most difficult part of this project was the art direction for the photos, but after a while, we finally got what we needed.
			</p>
			<p>
				I should also note I didn&rsquo;t implement the final content for the launched site; there have been a few design/front-end dev changes, some for the better, since I had my hands in it.

			<h3>Peeper&rsquo;s</h3>
			<h4>Unit Interactive</h4>

			<p>
				<a href="http://peepersdallas.com/">Peeper&rsquo;s</a> is one of the oldest (if not <em>the</em> oldest) boutique luxury eyeglass shops in Dallas,  located in <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&source=embed&hl=en&geocode=&q=64+Highland+Park+Village,+Dallas,+TX&aq=0&sll=32.836941,-96.806717&sspn=0.010529,0.022101&vpsrc=0&ie=UTF8&hq=&hnear=64+Highland+Park+Village,+Dallas,+Texas+75205&ll=32.836941,-96.806717&spn=0.010529,0.022101&t=m&z=16">Highland Park Village</a>. They do not deal in bulk nor sell online, but rather, they make expert recommendations based on the individual. Also, when you bring your prescription in, Peeper&rsquo;s actually grinds the lenses in-house to fit your frames perfectly.
			</p>
			<p>
				As someone who <a href="/work/independent/">appreciates handmade stuff</a>, I thought that was the coolest thing; apparently not many eyeglass shops do that anymore. They were an absolute joy to work with.

			<h3>Can you define love?</h3>
			<h4>Personal work</h4>
			<p>
				<a href="http://canyoudefinelove.com">Can you define love?</a> is my longest-running personal project (since 2009). It <a href="https://dribbble.com/ryanrushing/projects/25129-Can-you-define-love">has taken many forms</a>, but has always been a collection of love definitions provided by people I interview and passers-by on the Internet.
			</p>
			<p>
				The current, and most logical, iteration is now on Tumblr (using a free theme). In the past I spent lots of time on the web development/design, and paid little respect to the content, but since Tumblr is largely accessed through users&rsquo; dashboard, it gives me no excuse to misdirect my attention back to the Look and Feel&trade;.

			<h3>Lettering</h3>
			<h4>Personal work</h4>

			<p>
				I&rsquo;ve been into lettering and calligraphy since about sophomore year of college when I was cheap and didn&rsquo;t understand the value of solid typefaces and well-constructed fonts.
			</p>
			<p>
				Until recently I&rsquo;ve only worked in two-dimensions, but <a href="http://dribbble.com/shots/1466132-Mightier-sculpture">discovering that third</a> one has been a carousel of emotions. Check out more lettering on <a href="http://dribbble.com/ryanrushing">Dribbble</a>. Or don&rsquo;t, whatever.

			<h3>North Point</h3>
			<h4>Freelance</h4>
			<p>
				<a href="http://npcc.cc">North Point</a> is a small, simple church in Old Town Lewisville, TX. Before the rebrand, there were several inconsistencies among the site and various logos, which didn&rsquo;t match the spirit of the church family.
			</p>
			<p>
				I have strong feelings on <a href="/writing/2012/02/19/on-church-design/">designing for churches</a>, but in this case the work was necessary. This logo was listed on Church Relevance as a <a href="http://churchrelevance.com/resources/top-church-logos/">top church logo</a> which is a thing apparently.

			<h3>Read-Rite</h3>
			<h4>Freelance</h4>
			<p>
				<a href="http://blogs.dallasobserver.com/mixmaster/2013/07/read-rite_market.php">The Read-Rite Market</a> was an all-day event celebrating the written word the social practice of reading. My wife and I worked with <a href="http://oilandcotton.com">Oil and Cotton</a> to create a logo for the occasion, and we also live-printed the official posters.
			</p>

			<p>
				Also, not long ago my wife and I rebranded/renamed ourselves and are now known as <a href="http://instagram.com/variousmfg">Various Mfg Co</a>; formerly we were known as We Create Happy. (New site coming soon.)
