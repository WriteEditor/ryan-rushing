			<h3>Bookstore</h3>
			<h4>Kalkomey</h4>
			<p>
				In the <a href="http://bookstore.kalkomey.com">bookstore</a> we sell digital versions of our handbooks and student manuals covering boating, hunting, and handgun safety. They match our printed publications used in classrooms.
			</p>
			<p>
				Through the power of infinity, you can enjoy perusing laws and regulations at any time, until your battery dies. This marks the first time I built anything in Shopify, and I&rsquo; really impressed with how easy they&rsquo;ve made it.

			<h4>Kalkomey</h4>
			<p>
				The homepages of <a href="http://boat-ed.com">Boat Ed</a>, <a href="http://hunter-ed.com">Hunter Ed</a>, etc. were in need of some love to align with our design, front-end development, and SEO guidelines. The project was fairly straightforward; the hardest part was organizing the new content.

			<h3>Iterative work</h3>
			<h4>Kalkomey</h4>
			<p>
				Most of the work we do isn&rsquo;t full-fledged redesigns, but rather, we build on small, incremental changes over time.

				The Agile (Scrum) framework, user testing, and product focus drives our working methods. These examples show the evolution of our footer, which can be seen on <a href="http://boat-ed.com">any</a> <a href="http://hunter-ed.com">course</a> <a href="http://bowhunter-ed.com">page</a>, our optimization of the header inside the courses and study guide, and the evolution of our shopping cart in the <a href="http://bookstore.kalkomey.com">Kalkomey Bookstore</a>.

			<h3>Peeper&rsquo;s</h3>
			<h4>Unit Interactive</h4>

			<p>
				<a href="http://peepersdallas.com/">Peeper&rsquo;s</a> is one of the oldest (if not <em>the</em> oldest) boutique luxury eyeglass shops in Dallas,  located in <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&source=embed&hl=en&geocode=&q=64+Highland+Park+Village,+Dallas,+TX&aq=0&sll=32.836941,-96.806717&sspn=0.010529,0.022101&vpsrc=0&ie=UTF8&hq=&hnear=64+Highland+Park+Village,+Dallas,+Texas+75205&ll=32.836941,-96.806717&spn=0.010529,0.022101&t=m&z=16">Highland Park Village</a>. They do not deal in bulk nor sell online, but rather, they make expert recommendations based on the individual. Also, when you bring your prescription in, Peeper&rsquo;s actually grinds the lenses in-house to fit your frames perfectly, which is the coolest thing ever, if you&rsquo;re keeping track.

			<h3>John Degroote</h3>
			<h4>Unit Interactive</h4>

			<p>
				<a href="http://johndegroote.com/">John Degroote</a> is a trustee, mediator and arbitrator in Dallas, and has worked on impressive high-profile cases. He also speaks and has <a href="http://johndegroote.com/resources.php">lots of resources</a> available for download. The most difficult part of this project was the art direction for the photos, but after a while, we finally got what we needed.

			<h3>Fine Dining</h3>
			<h4>Unit Interactive</h4>

			<p>
				In addition to client work, we also made internal stuff during my time at Unit Interactive. One such experiment was <a href="http://clearmenu.unitinteractive.com">Clear Menu</a>. Restaurant menus on the web are notoriously bad, so we set out to show what menus <em>could</em> look like using modern web technologies.
			</p>

			<p>
				I chose to develop a <a href="http://clearmenu.unitinteractive.com/fine-dining/">fine dining menu</a> (admittedly, so I could do some fancy lettering). What about prices? If you have to ask, well you probably can&rsquo;t afford my restaurant anyway. <i>flies away on gold-plated hovercraft</i>

			<h3>North Point Christian Church</h3>
			<h4>Freelance</h4>
			<p>
				<a href="http://npcc.cc">North Point</a> is a small, simple church in Old Town Lewisville, TX. Before this rebrand, there were several inconsistencies among the site and logos, which didn&rsquo;t match the spirit of the church family.
			</p>
			<p>
				I have strong feelings on <a href="/writing/2012/02/19/on-church-design/">designing for churches</a>, but in this case the work was necessary, and the church welcomed my changes. <strong>Bonus:</strong> This logo was listed on Church Relevance as a <a href="http://churchrelevance.com/resources/top-church-logos/">top church logo</a> which is a thing apparently.

			<h3>Can you define love?</h3>
			<h4>Personal work</h4>
			<p>
				<a href="http://canyoudefinelove.com">Can you define love?</a> is my longest-running personal project (since 2009). It <a href="https://dribbble.com/ryanrushing/projects/25129-Can-you-define-love">has taken many forms</a>, but has always been a collection of love definitions provided by people I interview and Internet travellers.
			</p>
			<p>
				The current, and most logical, iteration is now on Tumblr (using a lightly developed theme). In the past, I spent lots of time on the web development/design, and paid little respect to the content, but since Tumblr is largely accessed through users&rsquo; dashboard, and few users see the landing page of a website, I&rsquo;m forced to focus on the content.

			<h3>Lettering</h3>
			<h4>Various clients</h4>

			<p>
				I&rsquo;ve been into lettering and calligraphy since sophomore year of college when I was cheap and didn&rsquo;t understand the value of solid typefaces and well-constructed fonts. I accidentally became interested in hand-drawn typography.
			</p>
			<p>
				Until recently I&rsquo;ve only worked in two-dimensions, but <a href="http://dribbble.com/shots/1466132-Mightier-sculpture">discovering that third</a> one has been a carousel of emotions. Check out more lettering on <a href="http://dribbble.com/ryanrushing">Dribbble</a>, if you&rsquo;re into that.
