<h2>Work</h2>
<h3>Kalkomey</h3>
<h4>October 2012 to present</h4>

At Kalkomey I worked on almost every product we build.

	<h5>Interactive Learning Objects</h5>
	<p>
		Our courses are largely text-based, but there are <a href="http://www.hunter-ed.com/site/videos">beautiful videos</a> (award-winning!), animation in the course as well. The animations were orginally designed for desktop and created in Flash. Once we started on a mobile-first path, these Flash animations needed to be accessible on mobile devices, so the Interactive Learning Object redesign was started.

	<h5>Courses' home page redesign</h5>
	<p>
		Redesigned the courses' home page (<a href="http://boat-ed.com">boat-ed.com</a>, <a href="http://hunter-ed.com">hunter-ed.com</a>, etc.). The redesign focused on a creating a better mobile experience, bringing primary content to the forefront, altering the markup for (better) SEO.
