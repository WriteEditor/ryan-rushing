					<a href="http://rachelrushing.com">My wife</a> and I live in the Dallas, TX area without dogs, although we would like to rescue a Greyhound one day. While she's pursuing her <abbr title="Masters of Fine Arts">MFA</abbr> at <abbr title="University of North Texas">UNT</abbr>, we're both making stuff for our shop, <a href="http://wecreatehappy.com">The Happy Factory</a>. I'm also the curator of <a href="http://canyoudefinelove.com">Can you define love?</a>, a blog about people and their thoughts on love.
				</p>
				<p>
					I'm currently reading <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twenty_Thousand_Leagues_Under_the_Sea"><i>Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea</i></a> by Jules Verne. My favorite colors are cerulean and hot pink with glitter.

				<h3>Professionally</h3>
				<p>
					I&rsquo;m working at <a href="http://kalkomey.com">Kalkomey</a> as a UX Designer with a small team of smart people who are leading the world in providing recreational safety materials. The UX team designs and builds the online versions of the safety courses and e-publications, and we also interact with other teams, such as customer service and marketing. You know, everything that involves user experience.
				</p>

				<p>
					Before Kalkomey, I was a design strategist and support specialist at <a href="http://unitinteractive.com">Unit Interactive</a>, where I worked with a broad-range of clients like <a href="http://woot.com">Woot!</a>, <a href="http://johndegroote.com">John Degroote</a>, and <a href="http://peepersdallas.com">Peeper&rsquo;s</a>. Also, as the customer support specialist, a huge part of my job was customer support for <a href="http://unify.unitinteractive.com">Unify</a>.
				</p>

				<h3>My Tools</h3>

				<p>
					Generally I use Photoshop for quick design comps, then get into the browser as soon as possible. Using Sublime Text 2 + iA Writer + Dropbox to sync everything across devices, except my phone. I do not have a smartphone, I have an indescructible Nokia from 2002.
				</p>
				<p>	
					The technologies I use when building the web include HTML, CSS, some JavaScript (still learning it), and perhaps <a href="http://wordpress.org">Wordpress</a>, <a href="http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/">Twitter Bootstrap</a>, and <a href="http://gridsetapp.com">Gridset</a>, depending on the project. I'm also familiar with CodeIgniter, and I'm currently learning Ruby on Rails and <a href="http://git-scm.com/">Git</a> since joining Kalkomey.
				</p>
				<p>
					As for making things outside of code or writing, I draw lettery things, screenprint, sculpt, make books, and developing my illustration skills.
				</p>
				
				<h3>This Site</h3>
				<p>
					Previously, my personal site has been built using Smarty, Wordpress, static pages for use with Unify, and now it's built with <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>, a static site generator. For the underlying grid, I'm using the fantastic <a href="http://gridsetapp.com">Gridset</a> by the team at <a href="http://markboultondesign.com/">Mark Boulton Design</a>.
				</p>
				<p>
					While the fonts may vary between case studies, the primary font is <a href="http://www.google.com/webfonts/specimen/Bitter">Bitter</a>, hosted by Google.
