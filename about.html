		I&rsquo;m a guy from a small-town in Louisiana living in Dallas, TX with <a href="http://rachelrushing.com">my wife</a> and <a href="https://secure.flickr.com/photos/ryanrushing/sets/72157634473776631/">dog</a>. We were scared to death to drive on the interstates when we first moved here. It took us forever to get anywhere. Now I&rsquo;m a big fan of public transit and only a little bit scared of the interstates.

		I&rsquo;m working at <a href="http://kalkomey.com">Kalkomey</a> doing design, front-end development, and animation with a lot of smart people building experiences to teach people how to be safe while having fun. Take a look at my <a href="/work/">work</a>, or if you&rsquo;re looking for more folks check out my <a href="/about/friends/">friends and recommendations</a>.

		Graduating <a href="http://art.latech.edu">college</a> was a big deal for my family and me; I&rsquo;m the first college graduate, and my sisters weren&rsquo;t far behind me. I was <a href="/writing/2013/08/05/design-team-as-maching-band/">in the marching band</a> for four years, and even joined a <a href="http://kkpsi.org">marching band service organization</a>. As much as college guided my growth as a person, my web skills are almost entirely self-taught or learned from a mentor. By working with people smarter than me, reading blogs, building and rebuilding personal projects, and most recently, subscribing to <a href="http://codeschool.com">Code School</a>, I am exploring new technologies, tools, and techniques.
