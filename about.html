		I'm a guy from a small-town in Louisiana living in Dallas, TX with <a href="http://rachelrushing.com">my wife</a> and <a href="https://secure.flickr.com/photos/ryanrushing/sets/72157634473776631/">dog</a>. We were scared to death to drive on the interstates when we first moved here. It took us forever to get anywhere. Now I'm a big fan of public transit and only a little bit scared of the interstates.

		I'm working at <a href="http://kalkomey.com">Kalkomey</a> doing design, front-end development, and animation with a lot of smart people building experiences to teach people how to be safe while having fun.
