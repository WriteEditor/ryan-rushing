<p>When I was in high school a friend told me he could eat an apple in five bites.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All of it?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yep,&rdquo; he replied as his teeth gripped one side of the apple.</p>
<p>He struggled with chewing each bite, but sure enough, he did it. Ever since then, I eat the whole apple&hellip; though I usually take smaller bites.</p>

<p>I'm a designer, front-end developer, and I also draw lettering, screenprint, and sculpt. I'm always interested in new things and ideas, whether that means learning a programming language or trying out a new way to eat apples.</p>
